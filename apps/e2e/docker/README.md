# Local end-to-end run across a real network boundary

`bun run --cwd apps/e2e test:docker` (from anywhere in the repo) stands up the
remote-host stack the way it is deployed and drives it from a container that
can reach the host only through the relay.

| Piece       | Where it runs                   | How                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Postgres    | Docker                          | `postgres:18`                                                  |
| Account API | Docker                          | `apps/api/Dockerfile`, dev identity provider, published on LAN |
| Relay       | Docker                          | `apps/relay/Dockerfile`, published on LAN                      |
| Host        | **this machine**, built Node 24 | `apps/server`, enrolled via `synara auth --device-code`        |
| Client      | Docker, isolated                | `Dockerfile.client`; an iptables pinhole to API + relay only   |

The API's public URL is the machine's LAN IP. Every JWT in the system (grants,
tickets, mint requests, DPoP) is bound to that string as issuer or audience, so
the host on this machine and the client in the container must name it
identically — the LAN IP is the one address both can route to.

## What it proves

`client.ts` runs the production protocol from inside the isolated container:
device key + proof-of-possession registration, single-use grant, relay splice,
pinned TLS 1.3 host authentication and exact-device owner pairing, host mint handshake, DPoP authorize, then real Synara RPC (`server.getConfig`,
`server.getEnvironment`) over the bridged session — text and binary framed,
sequential and concurrent. It then checks the three things the per-service
suites cannot: a spent grant is refused with the documented close code, device
revocation kills the live session through API → relay → host, and after the
relay is restarted under the live host a fresh device still gets through.

Only when explicitly enabled with `SYNARA_E2E_AGENT=1`, the client runs a **real agent turn** after the transport scenarios: the
production orchestration commands the web composer sends (`project.create`,
`thread.create`, `thread.turn.start` with `claudeAgent`), observed on the
production thread event stream, with the model reply matched on a nonce the
prompt asked the model to echo. The provider call runs on the host with
whatever Claude credential this machine has — the isolated client never holds
one, which is the point. It spends provider quota and is disabled by default; `SYNARA_E2E_AGENT_MODEL` picks the model (default `claude-sonnet-5`).

Isolation is asserted, not assumed. A positive-control container proves the
host's port IS reachable from Docker; the isolated client proves it is NOT
reachable from inside the pinhole, along with `host.docker.internal`, the API
container's name, and the internet.

## Prerequisites

Build the three images once from the repository root (the deps layer is
shared, so the second and third are fast):

```
docker build -f apps/api/Dockerfile          -t synara-e2e/api:local .
docker build -f apps/relay/Dockerfile        -t synara-e2e/relay:local .
docker build -f apps/e2e/docker/Dockerfile.client -t synara-e2e/client:local .
```

Use Node 24 on PATH and run `bun run build` first. The host and isolated client run under Node 24; the relay runs Bun. Each invocation uses unique container/network names and an isolated temporary home. API, relay and host ports are allocated dynamically; optional `SYNARA_E2E_API_PORT`, `SYNARA_E2E_RELAY_PORT` and `SYNARA_E2E_HOST_PORT` overrides must be free. Pairing invitations reach the client through stdin and the owner approves the exact registered device key.

`SYNARA_E2E_KEEP=1` leaves everything running for inspection. Logs, including
each container's stdout and the host's, land in the printed temporary run directory. `SYNARA_E2E_PARENT_DIR` changes its parent directory.

`SYNARA_E2E_STACK_ONLY=1` starts only Postgres, the API and the relay and
leaves them running, printing the `SYNARA_ACCOUNT_URL` / `SYNARA_RELAY_URL`
to point desktop apps at. Sign-in codes appear in the API container's logs
(`docker logs -f <printed-api-container-name>`, filtering for `dev-identity`); any email works.

The host receives the dev identity API's actual scoped refresh token after headless enrollment, so its owner session can rotate rather than relying on a placeholder token. The TLS migration of this Docker harness has passed source typechecking and client bundling. A working Docker daemon is required for runtime qualification; those source checks do not prove the container network boundary.
